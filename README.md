# Functions

Here I revisit and practice the Java Fundamentals that I previously learned at Zip Code Wilmington coding bootcamp:

- Organizing code into functions 
- Defining functions that take parameters 
- Calling functions and passing in arguments 
- Describing functions using Java Docs
- Return values 

In the end, I complete a small interactive project that tests the concepts that I've learned in this section. 

# Dice Jack
A simple dice game with the following rules:

<b>Rules</b>

<b>User wins if:</b>
- The sum of dice rolls is smaller than the sum of numbers chosen
- AND the difference between the two numbers is less than three
